.SH NAME
lbbma \- CUTEr L-BFGS-B test driver

.SH SYNOPSIS
lbbma

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIlbbma\fP main program test drives L-BFGS-B on SIF problems from the
CUTEr distribution.

The L-BFGS-B package is a limited-memory algorithm 
for bound-constrained minimization by Richard Byrd 
(U. Colorado at Boulder) and P. Lu, Jorge Nocedal. 
and. C. Zhu (Northwestern U.)

.SH USAGE
The L-BFGS-B file routines.f should be edited to remove the
subroutines TIMER, DNRM2, DAXPY, DCOPY, DDOT and DSCAL, and
renamed lbfgsb.f. It should then be compiled, and the f
resulting file lbfgsb.o placed in (or symbolically linked to) 
the directory $MYCUTER/double/bin.

There is no single-precision version.

.SH NOTE
If no LBFGSB.SPC file is present in the current directory,
the default version is copied from
$CUTER/common/src/pkg/lbfgsb/. Default specifications are as
follows:

.nf
.ta 1i 2i 3i
         5   M,      the maximum number of variable metric corrections
     10000   MAXIT,  the maximum number of iterations
        -1   IPRINT  print level (<0,none,=0,one line/iteration,>1,more detail)
    1.0D+7   FACTR,  the function accuracy tolerence (see hint below)
    1.0D-5   PGTOL,  the absolute projected gradient decrease required
.fi
Hint - the iteration will stop when

         (f^k - f^{k+1})/max{|f^k|,|f^{k+1}|,1} <= factr*epsmch

where epsmch is the machine precision, which is automatically generated 
by the code. Typical values for factr: 1.D+12 for low accuracy; 1.D+7 
for moderate accuracy; 1.D+1 for extremely high accuracy.

The reader is referred to the paper quoted below and the code itself if he or
she wishes to modify these parameters.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
