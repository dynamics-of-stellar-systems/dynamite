WHAT IS UNCMIN?
---------------

The UNCMIN package is designed for unconstrained minimization and has options
that include both line search and trust region approaches.
The provided options include analytic gradients or difference
approximations with analytic Hessians or finite difference Hessians
(from analytic or finite difference gradients) or secant methods (BFGS).


COMPILING THE OBJECT MODULE FOR UNCMIN
--------------------------------------

For correct performance, IEEE flags should be set for the compiler,
wherever appropriate.  (Otherwise, the machine precision EPSM may not
be calculated correctly by UNCMIN.)  On an RS/6000, for example, the
UNCMIN source should be compiled with at least the following flags:

xlf -qrndsngl -c uncmins.f

where uncmins.f is the file containing the single precision UNCMIN source.
Of course, you may wish to use additional flags for optimization, debugging,
etc.

The resulting single precision object file uncmins.o should be placed in
the directory $CUTER/common/src/pkg/uncmin or $MYCUTER/single/bin under the
name uncmin.o. The same applies when working in double precision, where
uncmin.o should be found under $MYCUTER/double/bin.


USING THE UNCMIN INTERFACE TOOL
-------------------------------

Suppose you wish to solve the problem written in SIF format contained
in the file probname.SIF.

The UNCMIN interface tools require two input files:

   probname.SIF   specifies the problem in SIF format
   UNCMIN.SPC     sets values for UNCMIN run-time parameters

If no UNCMIN.SPC file is present in the current directory, the default
version is copied from the $CUTER/common/src/pkg/uncmin directory. 
This default file is as follows:

       1.0   TYPX    typical size for each component of X
       1.0   FSCALE  estimate of scale of minimization function
         1   METHOD  algorithm to use to solve minimization problem
         0   IEXP    =0 if minimization function not expensive to evaluate (0/1)
         8   MSG     message to inhibit certain automatic checks + output 
        -1   NDIGIT  number of good digits in minimization function (-1 = all)
      1000   ITNLIM  maximum number of allowable iterations
         1   IAGFLG  =0 if analytic gradient not supplied (0/1)
         1   IAHFLG  =0 if analytic hessian  not supplied (0/1)
      -1.0   DLT     initial trust region radius (-1 = uncmin chooses)
   0.00001   GRADTL  gradient tolerance for convergence
   0.00001   STEPL   minimum steplength

The commands to use this package are the two scripts
sdunc and unc.

The reader is referred to the paper quoted below and the code itself if he or 
she wishes to modify these parameters.
