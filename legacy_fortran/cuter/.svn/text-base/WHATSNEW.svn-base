======================================================================

[January, 2007]. Updated MEX interface to return the complete sparse
                 Hessian instead of the lower triangle only, for
                 consistency with the dense tools.

[September, 2005]. Added new tools pbname, varnames and connames. See
                   man pages for details.

[July, 2005]. Added updated interface to KNITRO 4.0. Added support for
              the GNU gfortran Fortran 90/95 compiler. This compiler
              is now part of GCC 4.x and is not to be confused with
              g95.

[June, 2005]. Updated nearly all man pages. They now contain equations
              which are best viewed using
                    man -p e manpage
              Check your local man settings.

[March, 2005]. Added support for MAC/OSX platform with GNU or NAG f95
               compiler. Thanks to Mike Friedlander! Fixed a problem
               with intrinsic function ABS in CG+ interface. Fixed an
               annoyance with comments starting with 'CS' in the IPOPT
               interface (caused troubles in single precision). Thanks
               to Ling-Yun Wu.

[September, 2004]. Added interfaces to the packages CG+, CG_DESCENT,
                   TRON, LBFGS and L-BFGS-B. The interface to
                   L-BFGS-B supersedes the older interface. The one
                   to LBFGS supersedes the older interface to VA15.

[August, 2004]. Fixed compatibility issues between g95 and gcc.

[May, 2004]. Added support for GNU g95 Fortran 90/95 compiler.

[December, 2003]. Added support for version 8.0 of the Intel Fortran
                  and C/C++ compilers.

[October, 2003]. Added a spec file for LOQO, thanks to Hande Benson.
                 Fixed man pages for UPROD and CPROD. Fixed a bug
                 with cpp on Sun machines running Solaris.

[June,   2003].  Added an interface to NITSOL (Pernice and Walker).
                 Added the flags -L, --blas and --lapack to the CUTEr
                 scripts. See the man pages for details.

[March,  2003].  The installation  is  now  independent  of Imake  and
                 msub.  Imakefiles  have been replaced  by Umakefiles,
                 which  are also  meta-Makefiles, bootstrapped  by the
                 umake scripts, supplied  with SifDec and CUTEr. Umake
                 only relies on cpp which  may safely be assumed to be
                 present on most systems. The C/C++ interface has been
                 polished and a generic driver is given.

[Dec 7,  2002]. Improved interface  to package filterSQP,  by Fletcher
                 and  Leyffer. For  more information,  see  the manual
                 pages  for   sdfil  and  fil  and   the  readme  file
                 $CUTER/common/src/pkg/filter/README.filter. 

[Oct 5, 2002]. Added  an interface to the object-oriented optimization
                 toolkit TAO (Benson,  Curfman McInnes, More, Sarich).
                 For more  information, see http://www.mcs.anl.gov/tao
                 or contact benson@mcs.anl.gov or sarich@mcs.anl.gov.

[Oct 5, 2002]. Added the C header file cuter.h aiding in the design of
		 interfaces  between  the  CUTEr  tools  and  packages
		 written   in   C.    Added   an  interface   to   the
		 linesearch-based   primal-dual   interior-point  code
		 LOQO,    authored    by    Robert   Vanderbei,    see
		 http://www.princeton.edu/~rvdb  for more information.
		 The corresponding scripts are  named lqo and sdlqo to
		 avoid  confusion  with  the main  'loqo'  executable.
		 This  interface demonstrates the  use of  cuter.h and
		 was  originally written  by Andreas  Wachter.  Please
		 note  that  interfacing Fortran  and  C  is not  only
		 platform-dependent   but   also   compiler-dependent.
		 Hence, not all possible combinations are supported at
		 this time. All comments and information on particular
		 compilers will be greatly appreciated. 

[June 6,  2002]. Added an interface to  the primal-dual interior-point
                 code  IPOPT,   authored  by  Andreas   Wachter.   The
                 corresponding   script   follow   the  usual   naming
                 convention, sdipopt and  ipopt. The main interface is
                 ipoptma.f, found  in $CUTER/common/src/tools and some
                 documentation may  be found in the man  pages as well
                 as      in       the      README      file      under
                 $CUTER/common/src/pkg/ipopt. For  more info on IPOPT,
                 see
