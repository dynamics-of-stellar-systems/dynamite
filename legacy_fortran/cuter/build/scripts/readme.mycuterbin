  Please read this file prior to any modification in this directory.

======================================================================

This   directory   contains  the   various   interfaces  to   existing
optimization packages, such as MINOS,  Snopt, Knitro, etc. The name of
the interfaces  matches the patters  pak and sdpak. For  instance, you
will find cob and sdcob, knit  and sdknit and so forth. The pak script
assumes  the problem  of interest  has already  been decoded  into the
appropriate fortran subroutines and data files. The sdpak script first
calls  the SIF  decoder on  the  specified problem  before spawning  a
process running the corresponding optimization package.

The targets accepted by the Makefile in this directory are

<interface_name>: 
	     casts  the named interface(s) against local  architecture
	     specifications,

all:         all of the above.

======================================================================

			      Good luck!
