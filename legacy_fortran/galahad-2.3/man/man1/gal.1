.TH gal 1
.SH NAME
\fBgal\fR \- Run a GALAHAD package on the result of a previously-decoded 
SIF file
.SH USAGE
.B gal architecture package
[options]
,

where 
.B architecture
is a string of the form machine.os.compiler 
indicating the machine/operating system/compiler combination to be used and
.B package
indicates the package required. 

The name
.B architecture
must match that of one of the files in the directory 
$GALAHAD/bin/sys , while 
.B package 
may be one of
.LP
.TP 1i
.BI lanb
LANCELOT B for general nonlinear programming
.TP
.BI filt
FILTRANE for nonlinear equations/inequlaities and nonlinear least-squares
.TP
.BI pre
PRESOLVE for presolving general linear or quadratic programs
.TP
.BI qpa
QPA for general quadratic programming using an active-set method
.TP
.BI qpb
QPB for general quadratic programming using an interior-point method
.TP
.BI qpc
QPC for general quadratic programming using a cross-over method
.TP
.BI eqp
EQP for equality-constrained quadratic programming

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B gal 
runs one of the GALAHAD large-scale nonlinear-optimization
package on the result of a previously decoded 
user-defined SIF file.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.TP 1i
.BI \-e
Use the load module 
.BI architecture.package
if it exits. The default is to create a new load module.
.TP
.B \-h
Print a list of these options and stop execution.
.TP
.BI \-r
Do not recompile the object files for the problem. The default is to recompile
existing problem source files.
.TP
.BI \-s
Run the single precision version of the package. The default is
to run the double precision version.
.TP
.B \-k
Keep the load module after use so that the problem may be rerun without further
compilation. The default is to delete the load module after use.
.TP
.B \-p
Profile the code (if possible)
.TP
.BI \-o " output"
Specify the 
.IR output
level, which must be one of
.B 0
(no output; the default)
.B 1
(a brief description of the steps performed)
.TP
.BI \-l " secs"
Set a limit of
.IR secs
seconds on the GALAHAD run. The default is 99999999 seconds.
.SH FILES
.TP 20

Free-form Fortran 90 source decoded from the SIF file 
previously created by sdgal
.TP
.IB file.o

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
The diagnostics produced by gal itself are intended to be self-explanatory.
