.SH NAME
CREPRT \- CUTEr tool to obtain statistics concerning function
evaluation and CPU time used.
.SH SYNOPSIS
CALL CREPRT( CALLS, TIME )
.SH DESCRIPTION
The CREPRT subroutine obtains statistics concerning function evaluation and CPU
time used for constrained optimization in a standardized format.

The problem under consideration
consists in minimizing (or maximizing) an objective function

over all
.EQ

.EN
\(mo
.EQ

subject to

general equations
.EQ

.EQ

\(mo

general inequalities
.EQ
c sub i sup l (x) ~<=~ c sub i (x) ~<=~ c sub i sup u (x),
.EN
.EQ

\(mo
.EQ

.EN

and simple bounds
.EQ
b sup l ~<=~ x ~<=~ b sup u.

The objective function is group-partially separable and all constraint functions are partially separable.

.SH ARGUMENTS
The arguments of CREPRT are as follows
.TP 5
.B CALLS \fP[out] - real array of length 7
gives the number of calls to the problem functions:
.TP 3
CALLS( 1 ): number of calls to the objective function
.TP
CALLS( 2 ): number of calls to the objective gradient
.TP
CALLS( 3 ): number of calls to the objective Hessian
.TP
CALLS( 4 ): number of Hessian times vector products
.TP
CALLS( 5 ): number of calls to the constraint functions
.TP
CALLS( 6 ): number of calls to the constraint gradients
.TP
CALLS( 7 ): number of calls to the constraint Hessians

.TP
.B TIME \fP[out] - real array of length 2:
.TP 3
TIME( 1 ): CPU time (in seconds) for CSETUP
.TP
TIME( 2 ): CPU time (in seconds) since the end of CSETUP.
.LP
.SH NOTE
Note that CALLS(4), CALLS(5) and CALLS(6) may account for codes which allow the
evaluation of a selection of constraints only and may thus be much smaller than
the number of constraints times the number of iterations.
