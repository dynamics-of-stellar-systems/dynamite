.SH NAME
UBANDH \- CUTEr tool to extract a banded matrix out of the Hessian
matrix.
.SH SYNOPSIS
CALL UBANDH( N, GOTH, X, NSEMIB, BANDH, LBANDH )
.SH DESCRIPTION
The UBANDH subroutine extracts the elements which lie within a band
of given semi-bandwidth out of the Hessian matrix of the objective
function of the problem decoded from a SIF file by the script
\fIsifdecode\fP at the point X.

The problem under consideration
consists in minimizing (or maximizing) an objective function
.EQ
f(x)
.EN
over all
.EQ
x
.EN
\(mo
.EQ
R sup n
.EN
subject to the simple bounds
.EQ
b sup l ~<=~ x ~<=~ b sup u.
.EN
The objective function is group-partially separable.

.LP 
.SH ARGUMENTS
The arguments of UBANDH are as follows
.TP 5
.B N \fP[in] - integer
the number of variables for the problem,
.TP
.B GOTH \fP[in] - integer
a logical variable which specifies whether the second derivatives of
the groups and elements have already been set (GOTH = .TRUE.) or if
they should be computed (GOTH = .FALSE.),
.TP
.B X \fP[in] - real/double precision
when GOTH = .FALSE., the derivatives will be evaluated at X. Otherwise
X is not used.
.TP
.B NSEMIB \fP[in] - integer
the required semi-bandwidth, i.e., the number of bands directly below
the diagonal of the Hessian.
.TP
.B BANDH \fP[out] - real/double precision
a two-dimensional array of dimension (0:LBANDH,N) which gives the
lower triangular part of the band segment of the Hessian. The diagonal
entry in column i is returned in location BANDH(0,i), while the entry
j places below the diagonal in column i may be found in location
BANDH(j,i),
.TP
.B LBANDH \fP[in] - integer
the actual declared size of the leading dimension of BANDH (with
LBANDH no smaller than NSEMIB). N.B. the leading component of BANDH
includes the index 0 so strictly, the size of the leading dimension is
LBANDH + 1.
.LP
.SH NOTE
GOTH should be set to .TRUE. whenever
.TP 3
(1) a call has been made to UDH, USH, UGRDH or UGRSH at the current point, or 
.TP
(2) a previous call to UBANDH, with GOTH = .FALSE., at the current point has been made.
.TP
Otherwise, it should be set .FALSE.
