WHAT IS TRON?
-------------

The TRON package is a trust-region Newton method for large-scale
unconstrained or bound-constrained minimization designed by
Chih-Jen Lin and Jorge More' (Argonne National Labs.).

HOW DO I GET TRON?
------------------

See

  http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/~more/tron/

COMPILING THE OBJECT MODULE FOR TRON
------------------------------------

All of the TRON .f files contained in src/tron, src/coloring and src/icf
should be compiled and the resulting files inserted into a random library 
libtron_cuter.a. For example, with appropriate fortran 77 compiler $F77 
and compiler flags $FFLAGS, move into the directory in which you have 
unpacked the TRON codes and issue the commands

  ( cd src/tron; make FC=$F77 FFLAGS=$FFLAGS LIB_NAME=../../libtron_cuter.a )
  ( cd src/coloring; make FC=$F77 FFLAGS=$FFLAGS LIB_NAME=../../libtron_cuter.a )
  ( cd src/icf; make FC=$F77 FFLAGS=$FFLAGS LIB_NAME=../../libtron_cuter.a )

The resulting double precision library libtron_cuter.a should be placed in
(or symbolically linked to) the directory $MYCUTER/double/lib.

There is no single-precision version.

USING THE TRON INTERFACE TOOL
-----------------------------

Suppose you wish to solve the problem written in SIF format contained
in the file probname.SIF.

The TRON interface tools require two input files:

   probname.SIF   specifies the problem in SIF format
   TRON.SPC     sets values for TRON run-time parameters

If no TRON.SPC file is present in the current directory, the default
version is copied from the $CUTER/common/src/pkg/tron directory. 
This default file is as follows:

         5     P        the number of vectors to hold factorization fill-in
      1000     MAXIT    the maximum number of iterations,
    0.0D+0     FATOL    the absolute error desired in the function
   1.0D-12     FRTOL    the relative error desired in the function
  -1.0D+20     FMIN     a lower bound for the function
    1.0D-1     CGTOL    the relative CG decrease required per iteration
    1.0D-5     GTOL     the required norm of the projected gradient

The commands to use this package are the two scripts sdtrn and trn.

The reader is referred to the paper quoted below and the code itself if he or 
she wishes to modify these parameters.
