WHAT IS CG+?
------------

The CG+ package is a nonlinear conjugate-gradient algorithm
designed for unconstrained minimization by G. Liu, Jorge 
Nocedal and Richard Waltz (Northwestern U.). A choice of three 
conjugate-gradient strategies, Fletcher-Reeves, Polak-Ribiere,
and positive Polak-Ribiere, are available.

HOW DO I GET CG+?
-----------------

See

  http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/software.html#cg

COMPILING THE OBJECT MODULE FOR CG+
-----------------------------------

The CG+ files cgfam.f cgsearch.f timer.f fcn.f should
be compiled and placed together into a random library libcgplus.a.
For example, with appropriate fortran 77 compiler $F77 and 
compiler flags $FFLAGS, move into the directory in which you have 
unpacked the CG+ codes and issue the commands

  $F77 $FFLAGS cgfam.f cgsearch.f timer.f fcn.f
  ar ru libcgplus.a cgfam.o cgsearch.o timer.o fcn.o

The resulting double precision object file libcgplus.a should be placed in
(or symbolically linked to) the directory $MYCUTER/double/lib.

There is no single-precision version.

USING THE CG+ INTERFACE TOOL
----------------------------

Suppose you wish to solve the problem written in SIF format contained
in the file probname.SIF.

The CG+ interface tools require two input files:

   probname.SIF   specifies the problem in SIF format
   CGPLUS.SPC     sets values for CG+ run-time parameters

If no CGPLUS.SPC file is present in the current directory, the default
version is copied from the $CUTER/common/src/pkg/cgplus directory. 
This default file is as follows:

        -1    IPRINT(1) specifies the frequency of output (<0: no output)
         0    IPRINT(2) specifies content of output (0: minimal)
         3    METHOD    method used (1=Fletcher-Reeves,2=Polak-Ribiere,3=P-R+)
         0    IREST     no restart (0) or restart every n iterations (1)
     10000    MAXIT     specifies the maximum number of iterations
   0.00001    EPS       specifies the required gradient accuracy

The commands to use this package are the two scripts sdcgp and cgp.

The reader is referred to the paper quoted below and the code itself if he or 
she wishes to modify these parameters.
