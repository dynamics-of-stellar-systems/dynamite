WHAT is STENMIN?
----------------

STENMIN is an optimization package which uses tensor methods to minimize a
nonlinear unconstrained problem where the Hessian is large and sparse. The
software allows the user to select between a tensor method and a standard
method based upon a quadratic model.  The tensor method models the objective
function by a fourth-order model, where the third- and fourth-order terms are
chosen such that the extra cost of forming and solving the model is small.

STENMIN has been written and is distributed by

CREATING THE OBJECT MODULE FOR STENMIN
--------------------------------------

Starting from the files distributed by A. Bouaricha, perform the
following steps on a UNIX system (or equivalent actions on other systems).

1) Use the makefile supplied in the distribution to obtain the double
   precision version of the stenmin.f and colmor.f files:

       f77 -o todble todble.f
       make stenmind.f
       make colmord.f

2) Concatenate these two files:

       cat colmord.f >> stenmind.f

3) In the resulting stenmind.f, remove the BLAS functions DCOPY, DNRM2, 
   DDOT and DSCAL. (CUTEr also uses these BLAS subroutines.  They are
   contained in the CUTEr Fortran file named linpac.f. To avoid multiply
   defined subroutines when STENMIN is linked with the CUTEr tools, the
   duplicate BLAS subroutines must be removed from STENMIN.)

4) Compile (but do not link) stenmind.f. The resulting object file stenmind.o 
   should be placed in your directory $CUTER/common/src/pkg/stenmin or in
   $MYCUTER/double/bin under the name stenmin.o.

5) You should also have a compiled double precision version of the Harwell 
   Subroutine MA27 named ma27d.o in your directory
   $CUTER/common/src/pkg/stenmin. This subroutine is requested by STENMIN.

The steps for obtaining the single precision version of STENMIN are identical,
except that the following substitutions should be made:

        todble      -->  tosngl
        stenmind.f  -->  stenmins.f
        colmord.f   -->  colmors.f
        DCOPY       -->  SCOPY
        DNRM2       -->  SNRM2
        DDOT        -->  SDOT
        DSCAL       -->  SSCAL
        stenmind.o  -->  stenmins.o
        ma27d.o     -->  ma27s.o

Note: If you have the Harwell Subroutine Library already available on your
system, an additional copy of MA27 is unnecessary.  You should edit the file
$MYCUTER/bin/stn to set the BLAS variable adequately.

USING THE STENMIN INTERFACE TOOL
--------------------------------

Suppose you wish to solve the problem written in SIF format contained
in the file probname.SIF.

The STENMIN interface tools require two input files:

   probname.SIF   specifies the problem in SIF format
   STNMIN.SPC     sets values for STNMIN run-time parameters

If no STNMIN.SPC file is present in the current directory, the default
version is copied from the $CUTER/common/src/pkg/stenmin directory. 
This default file is as follows:

      1000    ILIM,    the maximum number of iterations
   0.00001    GRADTL,  the relative gradient stopping tolerance
         2    GRDFLG,  the gradient availability and checking flag
         2    HSNFLG,  the Hessian availability and checking flag
       1.0    FSCALE,  the typical value of the objective function
       1.0    TYPX,    the typical value of the problem's variables
         1    METHOD,  the method used (0 = Newton, 1 = tensor )
        15    NDIGIT,  the number of accurate digits in function values
         1    MSG,     the output specifier

The commands to use this package are the two scripts
sdstn and stn.

The reader is referred to the paper quoted below and the code itself if he or 
she wishes to modify these parameters.
