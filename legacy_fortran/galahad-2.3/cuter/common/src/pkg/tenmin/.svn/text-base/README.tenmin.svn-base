WHAT IS TENMIN?
---------------

The TENMIN package is intended for problems where the cost of storing one n by
n matrix (where n is the number of variables), and factoring it at each
iteration, is acceptable.  The software allows the user to choose between a
tensor method for unconstrained optimization, and an analogous standard method
based upon a quadratic model.  The tensor method bases each iteration upon a
specially constructed fourth-order model of the objective function that is not
significantly more expensive to form, store, or solve than the standard
quadratic model.  

TENMIN is available via anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.colorado.edu, in the
directory pub/cs/distribs/tensor.  Any questions about this software should be
addressed to eskow@cs.colorado.edu

CREATING THE OBJECT MODULE FOR TENMIN
-------------------------------------

Copy the TENMIN source code, distributed in the file tensrd.f, into a 
new file named tenmind.f.  In tenmind.f, remove or comment out the BLAS
subroutines DCOPY, DDOT, and DSCAL.  In our version of the TENMIN source,
this corresponds to deleting or commenting out lines 2675 to 2814 at
the end of the file.  (CUTEr also uses the BLAS subroutines DCOPY, DDOT,
and DSCAL. They are contained in the CUTEr Fortran file named linpac.f
To avoid multiply defined subroutines when TENMIN is linked with the CUTEr
tools, the duplicate BLAS subroutines must be removed from TENMIN.)

Compile (but do not link) tenmind.f. The resulting object file tenmind.o
should be called tenmin.o and placed in the directory
$CUTER/common/src/pkg/tenmin or $MYCUTER/[single|double]/bin.

USING THE TENMIN INTERFACE TOOL
--------------------------------

Suppose you wish to solve the problem written in SIF format contained
in the file probname.SIF.

The TENMIN interface tools require two input files:

   probname.SIF   specifies the problem in SIF format
   TENMIN.SPC     sets values for TENMIN run-time parameters

If no TENMIN.SPC file is present in the current directory, the default
version is copied from the $CUTER/common/src/pkg/tenmin directory. 
This default file is as follows:

      1000    ILIM,    the maximum number of iterations
   0.00001    GRADTL,  the relative gradient stopping tolerance
         2    IAGFLG,  the gradient availability and checking flag
         2    IAHFLG,  the Hessian availability and checking flag
       1.0    FSCALE,  the typical value of the objective function
       1.0    TYPX,    the typical value of the problem's variables
         1    METHOD,  the method used (0 = Newton, 1 = tensor )
        15    NDIGIT,  the number of accurate digits in function values
         1    MSG,     the output specifier

The commands to use this package are the two scripts
sdten and ten.

The reader is referred to the paper quoted below and the code itself if he or 
she wishes to modify these parameters.
