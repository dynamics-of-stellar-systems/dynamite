WHAT IS SNOPT?
--------------

The SNOPT package is designed to minimize smooth functions subject to
constraints, which may include simple bounds, linear constraints, and smooth
nonlinear constraints.  The software uses a sequential quadratic programming
algorithm, where bounds, linear constraints and nonlinear constraints are
treated separately.  SNOPT stores all matrices in dense format,
and is therefore not intended for large sparse problems.  

SNOPT has been written by Gill, Murray, Saunders and Wright, and is available
from the Office of Technology Licensing at Stanford University.


CREATING THE OBJECT MODULE FOR SNOPT6.1
---------------------------------------

Assuming Snopt6.1 was installed under the directory $SNOPT6.1 on your system,
you should have the following library file

	$SNOPT6.1/lib/libcutesnopt.a

Note that SNOPT is only available in double precision.

Either copy the above file in

	$MYCUTER/double/lib

or create a symbolic link pointing to it.


USING THE SNOPT INTERFACE TOOL
------------------------------

Suppose you wish to solve the problem written in SIF format contained
in the file probname.SIF.

The SNOPT interface tools require two input files:

	probname.SIF   specifies the problem in SIF format
	SNOPT.SPC      sets values for SNOPT parameters

If no SNOPT.SPC file is present in the current directory, the default
version is copied from the $CUTER/common/src/pkg/snopt directory.

The main output from SNOPT is written (by default) in a file named fort.9.
This file is subsequently renamed to probname.snp by sdsnp. If this unit
number has been changed in the SNOPT source code, then it must also be changed
in the shell script (sd)snp. The unit number may also be changed in the
SNOPT.SPC file, by adding the following lines (the second being optional):

	Print file		output_id
	Print frequency		k

which sends one line of the QP iteration log to the file having descriptor 
output_id every k-th minor iteration. This requires

	Minor print level

to be positive. It is *not* the case in the default CUTEr spec file.

In addition, SNOPT can create a summary of the problem output.
By the source code default, this summary is sent to unit 6 (stdout).
If you wish to direct the summary output elsewhere, you may include the lines,
the second line being optional

	Summary file		output_id
	Summary frequency	k

which sends one line of the QP iteration log to the device having descriptor 
output_id every k-th minor iteration. This requires

	Minor print level

to be positive. It is *not* the case in the default CUTEr spec file.

The commands to use this package are the two scripts
sdsnp and snp.


THE SNOPT SPECIFICATIONS FILE
-----------------------------

The file SNOPT.SPC may be used to set various SNOPT parameters.
These parameters are described in the section 'Description of the optional
parameters' in the User's Guide for SNOPT.

The CUTEr default version of SNOPT.SPC is as follows

 BEGIN SNOPT Problem
    Jacobian                   SPARSE  * Needed by the CUTE interface
 
    Derivative level                3
 
    Superbasics limit            2000 

    Major iterations             2000
    Iteration limit           1000000

    Major print level               1
    Minor print level               0

    Verify level                   -1
    Solution                       No
 END SNOPT Problem
