  Please read this file prior to any modification in this directory.

======================================================================

This directory now hosts both  the single AND double precision version
of  the tools  for the  architecture  which you  selected. Please  pay
attention to  one major  difference, due to  the cohabitation  of both
precisions:

The   script    ./install_mycuter   now   REQUIRES    a   command-line
argument.  Indeed,  it  needs  to  know whether  you  are  willing  to
(re)build  the  single  or  double  precision  version  of  CUTEr.  To
(re)build the single precision version, type

    % ./install_mycuter -DSinglePrecision

To (re)build the double precision version, type

    % ./install_mycuter -DDoublePrecision

This syntax is  intended to be both intuitive and  to follow the lines
of common  Unix tools, such  as make, the  C compiler, and  every tool
where preprocessor variables may be defined.

Also, pay attention to the fact  that this argument is passed along to
an  imake  command.  Therefore  if  you have  just  built  the  single
precision version using the first  of the two above commands, and want
to rebuild  the double precision version,  you will have  to issue the
second of the two above commands, in order to properly re-generate the
Makefiles.

Should  you   un-install  any  of  the  two   precisions,  the  script
install_mycuter will  be automatically updated and will  not require a
command-line argument any longer.

======================================================================

			      Good luck!
