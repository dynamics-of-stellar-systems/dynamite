CUTEr README file.				       September 2001.

======================================================================

  Please read this file prior to any modification in this directory.

======================================================================

This directory, among other files, should contain the following files:

cast.sed	a casting script for f77 files
cast90.sed	a casting script for f90 files
cmds		local commands
local.ff	partially cast f77 module
local.f		local.ff + timer
local.o		local.f compiled
script.sed	a casting script for interfaces
timer		a local timer in f77
tools.siz	sizings for libcuter.a

If you are using the script-based version of CUTEr, you may also find

local.sed	a casting script for local.f
sysdef		architecture-dependent specs

It  is NOT  recommended to  alter the  files cast.sed,  cast90.sed and
script.sed.   They  are  given  read-only attributes  at  installation
time. It  may happen,  however, that an  interface to  an optimization
package reports an  error at runtime, advising you  to adjust the size
of  one or  more  parameters  described in  tools.siz.   This will  be
necessary  to accomplish  your task.   However, in  any  case, proceed
cautiously and at your own risk.

The Makefile found in this directory recognizes the following targets:

cast.sed
cast90.sed
script.sed:  creates the script described above

local.o:     casts and compile (but does not link)  the fortran module
             local.f for later linking,

cmds:        creates the file cmds containing appropriate commands for
	     the local architecture,

script.sed:  casting script for the CUTEr interfaces,


======================================================================

			      Good luck!
