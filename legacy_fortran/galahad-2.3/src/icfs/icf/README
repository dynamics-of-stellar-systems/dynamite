           INSTRUCTIONS
          
The compressed tar file icf.tar.gz contains the MINPACK-2 
incomplete Cholesky factorization and a test program.

1. Create the icf directory structure with

       gzip -d icf.tar.gz
       tar -xvf icf.tar

   This produces the directory icf and several subdirectories.

2. Change directories to icf and install icf with
 
       make libs

   This creates libraries in each of the subdirectories

3. Create the executable icf with
 
       make icfx
 
   and run the sample problems by executing icf.
   The timer in file dtimer.f assumes that elapsed time is 
   given by etime; you may need to modify this file.

4. Compare the output in icf.out with the output in icf.sun4

*****************************************************************

      INSTRUCTIONS for MATLAB interface
 
1. Change directory to the matlab subdirectory

2. If you have not installed the icf library
 
       make libs

3. Create the mex files with
 
       make matlab
 
   and run the test program cgtest.m from MATLAB
