This is a guide to installing  and running GALAHAD on Windows 2000 and
Windows XP platforms.

So far, installation  of GALAHAD on Windows platforms  has been rather
unsuccessful using  commercial tools and  compilers. Environments such
as  Microsoft Unix  Services for  Windows  and compilers  such as  the
Digital  Fortran Compiler or  the Intel  Fortran Compiler  for Windows
lack    flexibility    and   functionality    to    carry   out    the
installation. Below, the  only tools required are open  source and you
can download them from their respective website.

For the time being, SifDec and CUTEr (http://cuter.rl.ac.uk/cuter-www)
have  not been  ported to  the Windows  platform. Users  are therefore
limited to solving problems written in Fortran or in the AMPL modeling
language (http://www.ampl.com). If you  wish to use the AMPL interface
to  the  tools,  you  will  need  to download  and  install  the  AMPL
Library.  Obtaining  a   copy  of  the  AMPL  engine   is  the  user's
responsibility---AMPL is  not free software.  However, at the  time of
this writing,  a size-limited  student version of  the AMPL  engine is
available for download  from the main AMPL website.  The GALAHAD tools
that currently have an AMPL interface are QPA, QPB, QPC, PRESOLVE and
FILTRANE.

1. Requirements

 o A Windows 2000/XP platform

 o The MinGW/MSYS system

   The MinGW is the Minimalist GNU for Windows and allows one to build
   native  Windows executables  and  libraries which  do  not rely  on
   proprietary system libraries. Essentially, it consists in a port of
   the GCC  to the  Windows platform. The  MSYS is  a POSIX-compatible
   compilation environment  allowing one to use  configure scripts and
   GNU Makefiles.

   If  you are  familiar  with  any flavour  of  UNIX, the  MinGW/MSYS
   combination will feel like home.

   Both may be downloaded from http://www.mingw.org


 o The g95 free Fortran 90/95 compiler for Windows

   The g95 is a fork from the GNU project of building a GPL-compatible
   Fortran 90/95 compiler to be included  in the GCC. Note that g95 is
   different  from  the  Fortran  90/95  compiler  which  is  actually
   included in the  GCC, called gfortran. As of  this writing, the g95
   is  much  more  advanced  and  capable than  gfortran.   We  highly
   recommend it.


2. Installation of the tools

 o Download   MinGW/MSYS.   Navigate   to  the  download   page  from
   www.mingw.org and read  the instructions there.  More particularly,
   make sure you read the sections

     - Decompression and  Unarchiving Installing MinGW  (and possibly,
     - Updating MinGW) Installing MSYS (and possibly, Updating MSYS).

   You  will  need at  least  the  following  packages (although  for
   further development, you may want to download the full collection):

     + MinGW (MinGW-x.y.z.exe) + MSYS (MSYS-x.y.z.exe)

   You  may  also want  to  check the  Getting  Started  page in  the
   MinGWiki section of the website.

   The  two  exe  files   are  self-extracting  archives.   Start  by
   installing MinGW  and then MSYS.   Installation is the matter  of a
   few clicks.

 o Download the  port of g95 for MinGW  from www.g95.org.  Again, this
   is  a self-extracting executable  which will  install g95  into the
   main MinGW tree.   Let it set the environment  variables and finish
   the installation.

 o [Optional] Download the AMPL Library from
   ftp://netlib.bell-labs.com/netlib/ampl/solvers.tar
   Unpack  this  archive  in  the  directory  of  your  choice,  e.g.,
   somewhere  in  your   $HOME  in  the  MSYS  tree   and  follow  the
   instructions found in makefile.u  for installation in MinGW. Your C
   compiler  is  gcc. Set  the  AMPLDIR  environment  variable to  the
   directory containing the newly compiled amplsolver.a library.


3. Installation of GALAHAD

 Unpack  the GALAHAD  archive in  a  fresh directory  and execute  the
 install_galahad script.  Answer questions  as you are  prompted. Make
 sure to select MinGW as architecture and g95 as compiler.

 Should you encounter any  problem with the installation, please check
 the GALAHAD website and discussion forum.


Please send all comments/corrections to us. Good luck!
