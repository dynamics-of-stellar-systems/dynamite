In order to get GALAHAD working, here is what you need to do.

[-1. If you are hoping for advice about installing GALAHAD
   under Windows, see README.windows. If this isn't what you wanted, 
   try Dilipan Sebastiampillai's document lanb2win.pdf.]

0. If you plan to use GALAHAD to solve problems written as .SIF
   files, you should first install the package SiFDec
   (and set the environmental variable MYSIFDEC), see

      http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/cuter-www/sifdec/

   If, in addition, you plan to use the CUTEr interfaces to the GALAHAD 
   FILTRANE and/or QP routines, you will also need to have installed the 
   package CUTEr (and set the environmental variable MYCUTER), see

     http://hsl.rl.ac.uk/cuter-www/

   CUTEr is not necessary if you simply wish to use LANCELOT B
   to solve problems written as .SIF files.

   Furthermore, if you plan to use the AMPL interface, you must
   have installed a working version of the AMPL interface library, see

     ftp://netlib.bell-labs.com/netlib/ampl/solvers.tar

   This is not needed if you simply wish to use the GALAHAD packages
   stand-alone or via the CUTEr/SIF interface.

[ 1. Do yourself a favour ... get GNU make:

      http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html !

   GALAHAD is designed to be installed by any variant of the make 
   program that we are aware of, but such are the incompatibilities
   introduced by different vendors, we cannot be sure that make
   will work properly on your system. However, if you have 
   GNU make (sometimes known as gmake), we have high confidence 
   that your installation will be trouble free. ]

2. Put the file 

     galahad.tar.gz

   in a suitable directory for which the ./galahad 
   directory will be a sub-directory. 

3. Issue the commands

     gzip -d galahad.tar.gz
     tar xvf galahad.tar

4. Set the environment variable GALAHAD to point at the 
   ./galahad directory, i.e., 

   for the C shell (csh):

    setenv GALAHAD [full path to ./galahad directory]

   for the bourne again shell (bash)

    export GALAHAD=[full path to ./galahad directory]

   Make this a permanent setting by inserting this command
   in your in your .cshrc/.bashrc file (or whichever shell resource file 
   is appropriate for you) and "source" the file. See 
   ./galahad/doc/README.cshrc and ./galahad/doc/README.bashrc for
   more details.

5. If you are intending to use the AMPL interface, set the environment 
   variable AMPLDIR to point to the directory in which you have installed 
   the AMPL interface library i.e., 

   for the C shell (csh):

    setenv AMPLDIR [full path to the AMPL interface library directory]

   for the bourne again shell (bash)

    export AMPLDIR=[full path to the AMPL interface library directory]

   Make this a permanent setting by inserting this command
   in your in your .cshrc/.bashrc file (or whichever shell resource file 
   is appropriate for you) and "source" the file. Again, see 
   ./galahad/doc/README.cshrc and ./galahad/doc/README.bashrc for
   more details.

   [ -*-NB-*- If you plan to use AMPL with the Lahey lf95, Fujistu frt or 
      Intel ifort compiler, change

      extern void MAIN__( VOID );

    to

      extern int MAIN__( int, char** );

    ( *note* the double underscore) 

    somewhere around line 790 in $AMPLDIR/asl.h, as otherwise there will be 
    clashes between GALAHAD and AMPL C interfaces ]

6. Add the directory 

     $GALAHAD/bin

   to your search path (preferably in your .cshrc or similar
   file) so that you will be able to use the GALAHAD/CUTEr
   interfaces. Again, see ./galahad/doc/README.cshrc or 
   ./galahad/doc/README.bashrc for more details.

7. Look at the file ./galahad/src/makedefs/packages to see if
   you need to provide additional external packages, and 
   to find instructions on how to get them and where to put them. 
   In particular, if you wish to use any of the GALAHAD QP packages, 

      ... ** YOU MUST DOMWNLOAD THE SOURCE ** ....

   for the HSL Archive packages MA27 and MA33. Other external software
   may improve the performance of GALAHAD packages. If you wish
   to use the latest GALAHAD packages,

      ... ** YOU MUST DOMWNLOAD THE SOURCE ** ....

   for the HSL Archive package MA33.

8. To install GALAHAD for a particular machine/os/compiler
   combination, move into the $GALAHAD directory, 
   issue the command

     ./install_galahad

   and answer the questions as prompted. This command sets
   up machine/os/compiler-specific files, and (optionally)
   compiles all (or suitable sub-components) of GALAHAD.

   You may issue the ./install_galahad command for as many
   machine/os/compiler combinations as you wish to support.

9. To recompile the whole of GALAHAD, move into the directory

     $GALAHAD/src

   and issue the command

     make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/#

   where # is a string of the form 

      machine.os.compiler 

   created during one of the installations described in 8 above.
   If you want the single-precision version, the appropriate command is

     make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# PRECIS=single

10. To recompile LANCELOT B, move into the directory

     $GALAHAD/src/

    and issue the command

     make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# lancelotb

    where # is as in 8 above. To recompile all the QP routines, or the
    individual packages QPA, QPB or PRESOLVE, the required commands are

     make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# qp
     make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# qpa
     make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# qpb
     make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# pre

    To recompile the FILTRANE package and its dependencies, the required 
    command is

     make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# filtrane

11. To run the QP codes qpa/qpb/qpc on the CUTEr example EXAMPLE.SIF
   issue the command

     sdgal # qpa [other options] EXAMPLE[.SIF]

   or

     sdgal # qpa [other options] EXAMPLE[.SIF]

   or  

     sdgal # qpc [other options] EXAMPLE[.SIF]

   where # is as in 8 above, from the directory containing the SIF file.

   To rerun the most recently decoded example, issue the command

     gal # qpa -n [other options]

   or  

     gal # qpb -n [other options]

   See README.SIF for more details.

12. To run/rerun LANCELOT B on the CUTE example EXAMPLE.SIF
   issue the command

     sdgal # lanb [other options] EXAMPLE[.SIF]

   where # is as in 8 above, from the directory containing the SIF file.

   To rerun the most recently decoded example, issue the command

     gal # lanb [other options]

   See README.SIF for more details.

13. To run/rerun FILTRANE on the CUTE example EXAMPLE.SIF
   issue the command

     sdgal # filt [other options] EXAMPLE[.SIF]

   where # is as in 8 above, from the directory containing the SIF file.

   To rerun the most recently decoded example, issue the command

     gal # filt [other options]

   See README.SIF for more details.

14. To test that the installation of GALAHAD has been successful, you can
    move into the directory 

      $GALAHAD/src

    and issue the command

      make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# test

    where # is as above -- for a single precision installation, the command is

      make -f $GALAHAD/makefiles/# test PRECIS=single

    To test LANCELOT, move into $GALAHAD/src/lanb , and issue the same
    command, to test the QP routines, do the same in the directory
    $GALAHAD/src/qp , and to test FILTRANE, do the same in the directory
    $GALAHAD/src/filtrane .

15. Postscript documentation for each package is available in the
    directory $GALAHAD/doc . Man pages for sdgal and gal are in
    $GALAHAD/man/man1 . You may wish to add $GALAHAD/man to your
    MANPATH environment variable.

16. If you are not using CUTEr, the GALAHAD link library for the
    precision you compiled with is in $GALAHAD/objects/#/(precision)/
    where (precision) is double or single, and # is as above.
    You should add this to your LIBPATH environment variable, 
    and may then link the library with the -lgalahad compiler flag.

17. If you like using graphical user-interfaces, why not try the GALAHAD 
     python GUI(see $GAHALAD/doc/README.gui for details).

18. Refer to the GALAHAD WWW page 

      http://galahad.rl.ac.uk/galahad-www/

    for updates/bug fixes/news.

Best of luck
