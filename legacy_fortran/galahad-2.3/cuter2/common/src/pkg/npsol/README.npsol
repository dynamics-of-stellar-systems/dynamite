WHAT IS NPSOL?
--------------

The NPSOL package is designed to minimize smooth functions subject to
constraints, which may include simple bounds, linear constraints, and smooth
nonlinear constraints.  The software uses a sequential quadratic programming
algorithm, where bounds, linear constraints and nonlinear constraints are
treated separately.  NPSOL stores all matrices in dense format,
and is therefore not intended for large sparse problems.  

NPSOL has been written by Gill, Murray, Suanders and Wright, and is available
from the Office of Technology Licensing at Stanford University.


CREATING THE OBJECT MODULE FOR NPSOL
------------------------------------

Concatenate the following .f files into a single file named npsold.f:

   chsubs.f   f06subs.f     mcsubs.f      opsubs.f   srsubs.f
   cmsubs.f   lssolsubs.f   npsolsubs.f   qrsubs.f

Compile (but do not link) npsold.f.
The resulting object file npsold.o should be placed in your directory
$CUTER/common/src/pkg/npsol or $MYCUTER/[single|double]/bin under the
name npsol.o.


USING THE NPSOL INTERFACE TOOL
------------------------------

Suppose you wish to solve the problem written in SIF format contained
in the file probname.SIF.

The NPSOL interface tools require two input files:

   probname.SIF   specifies the problem in SIF format
   NPSOL.SPC      sets values for NPSOL parameters

If no NPSOL.SPC file is present in the current directory, the default
version is copied from the $CUTER/common/src/pkg/npsol directory.

The commands to use this package are the two scripts
sdnps and nps.

The main output from NPSOL is written (by default) in a file named fort.9, and
then renamed to NPSOL.LIS by nps.  (This file is subsequently renamed to
probname.nps by sdnps.)  If this unit number has been changed in the NPSOL
source code, then it must also be changed in the shell script nps.
The unit number may also be changed in the NPSOL.SPC file, by adding the
following line:

   Print File  n

where n is the new unit number.  Again, if fort.n is to be renamed to
NPSOL.LIS by nps, the unit number must also be changed in nps. 

In addition, NPSOL can create a summary of the problem output.
By the source code default, this summary is sent to unit 0, and thus
does not appear anywhere.  The CUTEr default version of NPSOL.SPC
includes the line

   Summary  6 

which means that the summary output is directed to standard output.
Of course, this line may be changed or deleted from NPSOL.SPC if
you wish to direct the summary output elsewhere.


THE NPSOL SPECIFICATIONS FILE
-----------------------------

The file NPSOL.SPC may be used to set various NPSOL parameters.
These parameters are described in the chapter 'Optional Input
Parameters' in the User's Guide for NPSOL.

The CUTEr default version of NPSOL.SPC includes only one line, to direct
the summary output to unit 6 (standard output).  All other parameters
therefore assume their default values.
