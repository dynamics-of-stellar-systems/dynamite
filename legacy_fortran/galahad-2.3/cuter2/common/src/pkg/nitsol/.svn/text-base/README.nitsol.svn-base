Package available from 

    ftp://ephraim.wpi.edu/pub/nitsol/nitsol.tar.gz

   ==============================
   To make NITSOL work with CUTEr
   ==============================

1. Dowload and unpack nitsol into any suitable directory

2. Build the appropriate NITSOL, LAPACK and BLAS libraries:

   make nitsol_lib
   make lapack_lib
   make blas_lib

   with appropriate fortran compiler and flags

3. move the libraries

   Nitsol/libnitsol.a

   to your $MYCUTER/(precision)/lib directory. 

4. If you DO NOT have machine-tuned blas &/or LAPACK
   libraries on your LIBPATH, also move

   Lapack/liblapack.a
   Blas/libblas.a

   to your $MYCUTER/(precision)/lib directory. 

That's it!

README in ftp://ephraim.wpi.edu/pub/nitsol is as follows:

Thanks very much for your interest in NITSOL. 

The code is currently in a "beta test" version, i.e., a version that is 
essentially complete but may be subject to a little more polishing and 
debugging. The current version is dated 4/28/03 and differs from the 
previous version in that (1) an error affecting usage of constant 
forcing terms has been corrected and (2) the comments describing usage 
have been extensively updated and improved. 

The tar file nitsol.tar in this directory (471K) unpacks into directories 
containing the NITSOL codes, makefiles, and a number of test problems. 
The file nitsol.tar.gz (95K) is a compressed version; to uncompress, use 
gunzip. 

If you are unable to unpack the tar file or the compressed tar file, 
you can download all the files one-at-a-time from the directory 
nitsol-distn and its subdirectories. 

For more about NITSOL, please see the SISC paper describing the 
algorithm, "NITSOL: a Newton iterative solver for nonlinear systems," 
M. Pernice and H. F. Walker, Special Issue on Iterative Methods, 
SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 19 (1998), 302--318. This can be found in 

  ftp://ephraim.wpi.edu/pub/papers/nitsol.ps.gz

I would very much appreciate being kept in touch with any results, 
reprints, etc., that come out of any work you do with NITSOL. Thanks.
