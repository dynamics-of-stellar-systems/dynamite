WHAT IS COBYLA?
---------------

COBYLA is a nonlinear programming code for unconstrained and constrained
problems, which only uses function values (no derivatives needed).  

COBYLA was written by M.J.D. Powell, DAMTP, Cambridge University, Silver
Street, Cambridge (GB) (email: mjdp@damtp.cambridge.ac.uk). It is available
from the author.


CREATING THE OBJECT MODULE FOR COBYLA
-------------------------------------

Create a file named cobyla.f containing the source code of the package.
Compile (but do not link) this file.  The resulting object file cobyla.o
should be placed in the directory $CUTER/common/src/pkg/cobyla or
$MYCUTER/double/bin under the name cobyla.o.

COBYLA is only available in double precision.

USING THE COBYLA INTERFACE TOOL
-------------------------------

Suppose you wish to solve the problem written in SIF format contained
in the file probname.SIF.

The COBYLA interface tools require two input files:

   probname.SIF   specifies the problem in SIF format
   COBYLA.SPC     sets values for COBYLA run-time parameters

If no COBYLA.SPC file is present in the current directory, the default
version is copied from the $CUTER/common/src/pkg/cobyla directory.
This default file is as follows:

  0.5       RHOBEG   the size of the simplex initially
  0.00001   RHOEND   the size of the simplex at termination
  8000      MAXFUN   the maximum number of function calls allowed 
  0         IPRINT   controls the amount of printing --- set to 0, 1, 2 or 3

The commands to use this package are the two scripts
sdcob and cob.

The reader is referred to the paper quoted below and the code itself if he or 
she wishes to modify these parameters.
