WHAT IS L-BFGS-B?
-----------------

L-BFGS-B is a nonlinear programming code for unconstrained or bound
constrained problems, using the limited memory BFGS quasi-Newton update.  

L-BFGS-B is available from J. Nocedal, Department of Electrical Engineering
and Computer Sciences, Nothwestern University, Evanston IL 60201, USA (email:
nocedal@venus.eecs.nwu.edu).


CREATING THE OBJECT MODULE FOR LBFGS
------------------------------------

Remove the subroutines daxpy, dcopy, ddot and dscal from the file of the LBFGS
distribution called routines.f and name the resulting file lbfgsd.f. (CUTE
also uses the BLAS subroutines daxpy, dcopy, ddot and dscal.  They are
contained in the CUTE Fortran file named linpac.f.  To avoid multiply defined
subroutines when LBFGS is linked with the CUTE tools, the duplicate BLAS
subroutines must be removed from LBFGS.)

Compile (but do not link) lbfgsd.f. The resulting object file lbfgsd.o 
should be placed in your directory $CUTER/common/src/pkg/lbfgs or 
$MYCUTER/[single|double]/bin under the name lbfgsb.o.


USING THE LBFGS INTERFACE TOOL
------------------------------

Suppose you wish to solve the problem written in SIF format contained
in the file probname.SIF.

The LBFGS interface tools require two input files:

   probname.SIF   specifies the problem in SIF format
   LBFGS.SPC      sets values for LBFGS run-time parameters

If no LBFGS.SPC file is present in the current directory, the default
version is copied from the $CUTER/common/src/pkg/lbfgs directory. 
This default file is as follows:

         5   M,      the maximum number of variable metric corrections
       0.0   FACTR,  the factor in built-in stopping test
   0.00001   GTOL,   termination criterion on infinity norm of the gradient
         0   IPRINT, the output specifier
         1   ISBMIN, the minimization method in the subspace
     10000   MAXIT,  the maximum number of iterations
     10000   MAXCLL, the maximum number of function calls

The commands to use this package are the two scripts
sdlmb and lmb.

The reader is referred to the papers quoted below if he or she wishes
to modify these parameters.
