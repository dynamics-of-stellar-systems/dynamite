WHAT IS L-BFGS-B?
-----------------

The L-BFGS-B package is a limited-memory algorithm designed 
for unconstrained or bound-constrained minimization by 
Richard Byrd (U. Colorado at Boulder) and P. P. Lu-Chen, 
Jorge Nocedal and Ciyou Zhu, (Northwestern U.). 

HOW DO I GET L-BFGS-B?
----------------------

See

  http://www.ece.northwestern.edu/~nocedal/lbfgsb.html

COMPILING THE OBJECT MODULE FOR L-BFGS-B
----------------------------------------

The L-BFGS-B file routines.f should be edited to remove the
subroutines TIMER, DNRM2, DAXPY, DCOPY, DDOT and DSCAL, and
renamed lbfgsb.f. It should then be compiled, and the
resulting file lbfgsb.o placed in (or symbolically linked to) 
the directory $MYCUTER/double/bin.

There is no single-precision version.

USING THE L-BFGS-B INTERFACE TOOL
---------------------------------

Suppose you wish to solve the problem written in SIF format contained
in the file probname.SIF.

The L-BFGS-B interface tools require two input files:

   probname.SIF   specifies the problem in SIF format
   LBFGSB.SPC     sets values for L-BFGS-B run-time parameters

If no LBFGSB.SPC file is present in the current directory, the default
version is copied from the $CUTER/common/src/pkg/lbfgsb directory. 
This default file is as follows:

         5   M,      the maximum number of variable metric corrections
     10000   MAXIT,  the maximum number of iterations
        -1   IPRINT  print level (<0,none,=0,one line/iteration,>1,more detail)
    1.0D+7   FACTR,  the function accuracy tolerence (see hint below)
    1.0D-5   PGTOL,  the required norm of the projected gradient

Hint - the iteration will stop when

         (f^k - f^{k+1})/max{|f^k|,|f^{k+1}|,1} <= factr*epsmch

where epsmch is the machine precision, which is automatically generated 
by the code. Typical values for factr: 1.D+12 for low accuracy; 1.D+7 
for moderate accuracy; 1.D+1 for extremely high accuracy.

The commands to use this package are the two scripts sdlbb and lbb.

The reader is referred to the paper quoted below and the code itself if he or 
she wishes to modify these parameters.
