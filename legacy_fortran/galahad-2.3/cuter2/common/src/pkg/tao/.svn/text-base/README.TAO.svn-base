**** TAO driver to run CUTEr test problems *******
**************************************************

Requirements: 
Before you can run the 'sdtao' or 'tao' CUTEr scripts, you must have:

1. TAO 1.10 installed on your system (see http://www.mcs.anl.gov/tao), 
	which also requires 

2. PETSc 3.1 (http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc)

3. and an implementation of MPI (if you don't have any MPI installed, 
   then you can configure PETSc using --download-mpich=1 option)


Installing for CUTEr:

1. Install CUTEr, TAO, PETSc, and MPI according to package directions.

2. Set environment variables TAO_DIR, PETSC_DIR, and PETSC_ARCH (See 
PETSc and TAO documentation for details)

3. CUTEr only builds tao scripts if TAO_DIR environment variable is set, so
you may need to update/reinstall CUTER


For documentation on TAO, see the TAO website http://www.mcs.anl.gov/tao.
