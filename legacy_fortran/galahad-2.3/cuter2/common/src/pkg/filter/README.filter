WHAT IS FilterSQP?
------------------

FilterSQP is a code for solving large-scale nonlinear programming
problems of the form

  minimize           f(x)
  subject to  l_x <=   x  <= u_x
              l_c <= c(x) <= u_c

The code is based on a trust-region SQP approach, and is globalized
using a filter mechanism. It uses first and second derivatives of the 
problem functions. 

The code was written by Roger Fletcher <fletcher@maths.dundee.ac.uk> and 
Sven Leyffer  <leyffer@mcs.anl.gov> of the University of Dundee, to whom 
all technical questions should be addressed.

USING FilterSQP WITH CUTEr
--------------------------

Change directory in to the appropriate './fil/single' or './fil/double' 
subdirectory of the untarred filterSQP distribution, depending on
the version you require. 

** IMPORTANT **

 * FilterSQP uses higer precision for certain key computations. Thus 
   if your compiler allows extended precision, only the single
   precision version will be avaqilable to you. *

 * If your compiler does not support the ieee_handler and ieee_flags 
   packages you will need to remove lines mentioning these calls from 
   all the .f files in this directory. *

Using the makefile make_NLP found in the directory, issue the command 

  gmake -f make_NLP filter.o filteraux.o QPsolves.o bqpd.o auxil.o sparseL.o \
    sparseA.o util.o scaling.o CUTEuser.o FORTRAN='f77'  COPTIONS='-O -c'
  
to create the FilterSQP installation procedure creates object files;
the arguments FORTRAN='f77' and COPTIONS='-O -c' should be adapted to
your local fortran compiler and its compilation flags. Having 
created the object files, now create the random library "libfilter.a" 
by issuing the command 

  ar rsu libfilter.a filteraux.o QPsolves.o bqpd.o auxil.o \
    sparseL.o sparseA.o util.o scaling.o CUTEuser.o

Copy (or link) the library libfilter.a to $MYCUTER/single/lib or
$MYCUTER/double/lib (as appropriate for the precision you have compiled)
with the name libfilter.a

USING THE FilterSQP INTERFACE TOOL
----------------------------------

Suppose you wish to solve the problem written in SIF format contained
in the file probname.SIF.

The FilterSQP interface tools require two input files:

	probname.SIF   specifies the problem in SIF format
	spec.par       sets values for filterSQP parameters

The spec.par file should be present in the current directory.

The commands to use this package are the two scripts sdfil and fil.
To decode probname.SIF and run filterSQP on the output, use

   sdfil probname

To rerun a previously decoded problem, use

   fil

THE spec.par FILE
-----------------

The file spec.par specifies parameters for filter and 
has a number of lines of the form

	keyword_list

where

	keyword_list = 	keyword   value
               		{keyword_list}

Each keyword must be on a new line. keyword is
one of the following, default values are also given

keyword         default        meaning

iprint          1              controls printing

maxiter         1000           max number of iterations

mxiwk           n/a            max size of integer workspace
mxwk            n/a            max size of real workspace
nout            6 (= screen)   output channel
nobj            n/a (1)        number of objective 
eps             n/a (1E-6)     tolerance
infty           n/a (1E20)     infinity
rho             10.0           initial TR radius
stackmax        n/a            stacksize for MINLP
tt              1.25           violation will be bounded by tt*initial violation
ubd             100.0          violation will be bounded by ubd

A default file is given in the file spec.par in $CUTER/common/src/pkg/filter
