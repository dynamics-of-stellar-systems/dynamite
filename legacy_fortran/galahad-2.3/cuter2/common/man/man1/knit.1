.SH NAME
knit/sdknit \- CUTEr interface with the KNITRO solver.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB[sd]knit\fP [\-decode] [\-n] [\-h] [\-k] [\-r] [-o \fI0|1\fP] [\-l \fIsecs\fP] [\-f] [\-b] [\-a \fI1|2\fP] [\-show] [[\-param \fIname=value\fP[\fI,name=value...\fP]] [\-force]] [\-debug] [\-L\fIpath/to/lib\fP] [\-\-blas \fIkeyword\fP] [\-\-lapack \fIkeyword\fP] [\fIproblem[.SIF]\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIsdknit\fP interfaces the KNITRO solver with the CUTEr tools and SIF-encoded
problems. \fIsdknit\fP applies the SIF decoder to the problem \fIproblem.SIF\fP
to produce the OUTSDIF.d file and the problem-dependant Fortan subroutines.
If \fIproblem.SIF\fP has already been decoded, the script \fIknit\fP
may be run by itself. KNITRO linearizes the nonlinear contributions to
the objective and constraint function so that linear programming
techniques can be exploited.

\fIsdknt\fP is only included for backward compatibility with earlier versions of CUTE, and simply calls \fIknit\fP with the \fI\-decode\fP flag.

\fIknit\fP links all the needed libraries and modules for the KNITRO
solver to solve the problem decoded from the SIF file and generates the
executable.
.LP 
.SH [sd]knit Options
You can start [sd]knit with the following options:
.TP 5
.B \-decode
Applies the SIF decoder to the problem \fIproblem.SIF\fP to produce the OUTSDIF.d file and the problem-dependant Fortan subroutines. It is redundant to call \fIsdknit\fP with the \-decode flag.
.TP
.B \-n
Use the load module if it already exists. Compiling a new load module
is the default.
.TP
.B \-h
Print a short help message.
.TP
.B \-k
Keep the generated executable after use. May be useful when solving a
particular problem with the same solver with different parameters.
Deleting the executable after use is the default.
.TP
.B \-r
Discourage recompilation of the test problem. Default is to recompile
object files.
.TP
.BI \-o " 0|1"
Regulates the output level of \fI[sd]knit\fP. Verbose mode is \fB-o\fP 1,
silent mode is \fB-o\fP 0. Silent mode is the default.
.TP
.BI \-l " secs"
sets a limit of \fIsecs\fP second on KNITRO runtime.
Unlimited cputime is the default.
.TP
.BI \-f
Use automatic differentiation in Forward mode
.TP
.BI \-b
Use automatic differentiation in Backward mode
.TP
.BI \-a " 1|2"
\-a 1 uses the older HSL automatic differentiation package AD01
and \-a 2 uses the newer HSL automatic differentiation package
AD02. \-a 2 is the default.
.TP
.BI \-show
displays possible parameter settings for problem[.SIF]. Other options
are ignored.
.TP
.BI \-param
cast problem[.SIF] against explicit parameter settings. Several
parameter settings may be given as a comma-separated list following
\-param or using several \-param flags. Use \fIsifdec -show problem\fP
to view possible settings. If a setting is not allowed in the SIF
file, no action is taken unless \fI \-force \fP is present.
.TP
.BI \-force
Forces the setting of the parameters named using \fI \-param \fP to
the given values, even if those values are not predefined in the SIF
file.
.TP
.BI \-L\fIpath/to/lib\fP
This option is passed directly to the linker and causes the path
\fIpath/to/lib\fP to be searched for libraries.
.TP
.BI \-\-blas " \fIkeyword\fP"
Overrides usage of the default \fIlinpack\fP library packaged with
CUTEr. Instead, use the BLAS library specified by \fIkeyword\fP. The
keyword \fIkeyword\fP has one of two forms. The first, \fI-lmyblas\fP
causes the linker to search for BLAS subprograms in the libmyblas.a
library. The second, \fInone\fP, causes the linker to skip inclusion
of any external BLAS. Use the first option if an optimized BLAS
library is available on the host system, e.g., the ATLAS BLAS. The
second option is useful for packages which already include the
necessary BLAS subprograms.
.TP
.BI \-\-lapack " \fIkeyword\fP"
Overrides usage of the default \fIlinpack\fP library packaged with
CUTEr. Instead, use the LAPACK library specified by \fIkeyword\fP. The
keyword \fIkeyword\fP has one of two forms. The first, \fI-lmylapack\fP
causes the linker to search for LAPACK subroutines in the libmylapack.a
library. The second, \fInone\fP, causes the linker to skip inclusion
of any external LAPACK. Use the first option if an optimized LAPACK
library is available on the host system. The second option is useful
for packages which already include the necessary LAPACK subprograms.
.TP
.I problem
\fIproblem.SIF\fP is the name of the file containing the SIF
information on the problem to be solved.
.SH ENVIRONMENT 
.TP
.SB CUTER
Home directory for CUTEr
.TP
.SB MYCUTER
Home directory of the installed CUTEr distribution.
.TP
.SB MASTSIF
A pointer to the directory containing the CUTEr problems
collection. If this variable is not set, the current directory is
searched for \fIproblem.SIF\fP. If it is set, the current directory is
searched first, and if \fIproblem.SIF\fP is not found there, $MASTSIF
is searched.
