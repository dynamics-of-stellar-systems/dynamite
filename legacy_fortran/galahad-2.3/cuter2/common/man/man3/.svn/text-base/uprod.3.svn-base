.SH NAME
UPROD \- CUTEr tool to form the matrix-vector product of a vector with
the Hessian matrix.
.SH SYNOPSIS
CALL UPROD( N, GOTDER, X, P, Q )
.SH DESCRIPTION
The UPROD subroutine forms the product of a vector with the Hessian
matrix of the objective function of the problem decoded from a SIF file
by the script \fIsifdecode\fP at the point X.

The problem under consideration
consists in minimizing (or maximizing) an objective function
.EQ
f(x)
.EN
over all
.EQ
x
.EN
\(mo
.EQ
R sup n
.EN
subject to the simple bounds
.EQ
b sup l ~<=~ x ~<=~ b sup u.
.EN
The objective function is group-partially separable.

.LP 
.SH ARGUMENTS
The arguments of UPROD are as follows
.TP 5
.B N \fP[in] - integer
the number of variables for the problem,
.TP
.B GOTDER \fP[in] - logical
a logical variable which specifies whether the first and second derivatives of
the groups and elements have already been set (GOTDER = .TRUE.) or if
they should be computed (GOTDER = .FALSE.),
.TP
.B X \fP[in] - real/double precision
when GOTDER = .FALSE., the derivatives will be evaluated at X. Otherwise
X is not used.
.TP
.B P \fP[in] - real/double precision
an array which gives the vector whose product with the Hessian is
required,
.TP
.B Q \fP[out] - real/double precision
an array which gives the result of multiplying the Hessian by P. 
.LP
.SH NOTE
GOTDER should be set to .TRUE. whenever
.TP 3
.B (1)\fP
a call has been made to UDH, USH, UGRDH or UGRSH at the current
point, or
.TP
.B (2)\fP
a previous call to UPROD, with GOTDER = .FALSE., at the current point has been made.
.TP
.B \fPOtherwise, it should be set .FALSE.
