                       TROUBLESHOOTING

In a perfect world, Unix would be Unix, and compilers
(and our codes!) would not have bugs. However ....

IF...

1. ...THE INSTALLATION FAILS
----------------------------

The first stage of  the installation generates makefiles and execution
scripts  appropriate for  the system  you have  described. All  of the
systems supported  are described in files  in the $SIFDEC/config
directory. Each file is named

  platform.cf

where platform is the machine you asked for. Examples include sun.cf,
linux.cf and ibm.cf. The special file all.cf contains common settings
which apply to all platforms.

If you  have  problems,  you  should  check  the  contents  of all.cf
and of the file appropriate to  your system and in particular, the
paths to the basic system commands and compiler settings.  You  might
try downgrading the level of optimization if appropriate, uninstalling
(using the uninstall script) and installing again.

The syntax  used in these  files is regular  cpp syntax and  should be
clear.


2. ...THE COMPILATION FAILS
---------------------------

Check (and edit if necessary) the Makefiles found in the directories

   $MYSIFDEC
   $MYSIFDEC/bin
   $MYSIFDEC/precision
   $MYSIFDEC/precision/config
   $MYSIFDEC/precision/bin
   $MYSIFDEC/precision/lib

and re-issue a 'make all' from $MYSIFDEC, paying special attention to
messages printed to the screen (redirect the output to a file if the
scrolling is too fast).

For changes to take effect in subsequent rebuilds, the Umakefiles in
the same directories should be modified correspondingly. Also,
remember that if your changes should apply system-wide, the Umakefiles
found in

   $SIFDEC/build/scripts

should be modified, along with the configuration files in

   $SIFDEC/config

if applicable. If you can fix your problem this way, please send us
a detailed report on the changes you made and we will be happy to
incorporate them in next releases of SifDec.

To incorporate system-wide changes into your local instance of SifDec,
it is safest to first

   ./uninstall_sifdec

from $SIFDEC, choose your local instance from the list and uninstall
it, then

   ./install_sifdec

from the same directory to re-install a fresh version.


3. ...THE RUN FAILS
-------------------

Check your environment variables settings. SIFDEC should point to the
directory where the distribution was unpacked and MYSIFDEC should
point to the local instance you are currently using. In addition,
MASTSIF should point to a directory containing the SIF file(s) you are
trying to decode, unless you are explicitly specifying a path on the
command line. Also, make sure $MYSIFDEC/bin appears in your PATH.

You may make sure there was no problem during the compilation by
changing to $MYSIFDEC and issuing

   make -s purge
   make all

and paying attention to messages printed to the screen.

Check the basic system commands file

   $MYSIFDEC/<precision>/config/cmds

and the configuration files

   $MYSIFDEC/config/<platform>.cf, and
   $MYSIFDEC/config/all.cf.

If you need to make changes to the configuration files, you will need
to re-issue the command

   ./install_mysifdec

from the directory $MYSIFDEC to re-generate the Makefiles and rebuild.

If you are trying to decode a problem in non-default dimensions, check
the names of the parameters which can be changed for each problem. The
command

   sifdecode -show <problem.SIF>

shows a list of possibilities, if any.

If the problem persists, inspect the script 'sifdecode', found in

   $MYSIFDEC/bin


4. KNOWN PROBLEMS WITH SPECIFIC SYSTEMS
---------------------------------------

4.1. f90/f95 under SOLARIS
--------------------------

Optimization has been disabled since any attempt at
optimization here leads to internal compiler errors here.
Please grumble to Sun!

5. BUG REPORTS
--------------

Please consult the file

   $SIFDEC/BUGS

If you think you have found a bug (even better, if you have
found and fixed one!), please let us know. We will make
every effort to issue bug fixes (although, this depends on our
having time, so no guarantees).
