This is a guide to installing  and running SifDec  on Windows 2000 and
Windows XP platforms.

So far, installation  of SifDec  on Windows platforms  has been rather
unsuccessful using  commercial tools and  compilers. Environments such
as  Microsoft Unix  Services for  Windows  and compilers  such as  the
Digital  Fortran Compiler or  the Intel  Fortran Compiler  for Windows
lack    flexibility    and   functionality    to    carry   out    the
installation. Below, the  only tools required are open  source and you
can download them from their respective website.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Requirements

 o A Windows 2000/XP platform

 o The MinGW/MSYS system

   The MinGW is the Minimalist GNU for Windows and allows one to build
   native  Windows executables  and  libraries which  do  not rely  on
   proprietary system libraries. Essentially, it consists in a port of
   the GCC  to the  Windows platform. The  MSYS is  a POSIX-compatible
   compilation environment  allowing one to use  configure scripts and
   GNU Makefiles.

   If  you are  familiar  with  any flavour  of  UNIX, the  MinGW/MSYS
   combination will feel like home.

   Both may be downloaded from http://www.mingw.org

   The famous GNU g77 Fortran 77 compiler is included in MinGW/MSYS.
   However, should you need to use a Fortran 90/95 compiler, read on.

 o [Optional] The g95 free Fortran 90/95 compiler for Windows

   The g95 is a fork from the GNU project of building a GPL-compatible
   Fortran 90/95 compiler to be included  in the GCC. Note that g95 is
   different  from  the  Fortran  90/95  compiler  which  is  actually
   included in the  GCC, called gfortran. As of  this writing, the g95
   is  much  more  advanced  and  capable than  gfortran.   We  highly
   recommend it.


2. Installation of the tools

 o Download   MinGW/MSYS.   Navigate   to  the  download   page  from
   www.mingw.org and read  the instructions there.  More particularly,
   make sure you read the sections

     - Decompression and  Unarchiving Installing MinGW 
       (and possibly, Updating MinGW)
     - Installing MSYS (and possibly, Updating MSYS).

   You  will  need at  least  the  following  packages (although  for
   further development, you may want to download the full collection):

     + MinGW (MinGW-x.y.z.exe)
     + MSYS (MSYS-x.y.z.exe)

   You  may  also want  to  check the  Getting  Started  page in  the
   MinGWiki section of the website.

   The  two  exe  files   are  self-extracting  archives.   Start  by
   installing MinGW  and then MSYS.   Installation is the matter  of a
   few clicks.


 o The shell implemented in MSYS is bash, the Bourne Again Shell, even
   though the executable is named sh. The bash shell supports many
   constructs not supported by sh and the SifDec scripts rely on bash.
   From the MSYS prompt, create a copy of sh.exe called bash.exe:

       # cd /bin
       # cp sh.exe bash.exe

   (unfortunately, there is no such thing as a symbolic link on the
   Windows system.) Do not delete sh.exe however, since other scripts
   may depend on it.

 o [Optional]
   Download the  port of g95 for MinGW  from www.g95.org.  Again, this
   is  a self-extracting executable  which will  install g95  into the
   main MinGW tree.   Let it set the environment  variables and finish
   the installation.


3. Installation of SifDec

 Unpack  the  SifDec  archive in  a  fresh directory  and execute  the
 install_sifdec script.  Answer questions  as you are  prompted.  Make
 sure to select MinGW as architecture and g77 (or g95) as compiler.

 Should you encounter any  problem with the installation, please check
 the CUTEr/SifDec website and discussion forum.


Please send all comments/corrections to us. Good luck!
