SifDec README file.					   March 2003.


======================================================================

Before you start to using this software, please read the file LICENSE,
	     located in the same directory as this file.

======================================================================

This README file should be located in the directory where you unpacked
the SifDec distribution. Its purpose is to get you started with SifDec
by

 (a) guiding you through the directory structure,
 (b) briefly describing how to install SifDec,
 (c) pointing to documentation, scattered over the subdirectories.

It was our intention to keep this REAME file short so as to get you up
and   running    with   SifDec   as   quickly  and    as   easily   as
possible. Documentation on all aspects  of the package may be found in
at least one form in the distribution. Different documentation formats
are available on a website at  http://cuter.rl.ac.uk/cuter-www/sifdec/

The information below is structured as follows


 I......The SifDec distribution and its directory structure.

 II.....Installing a first version of SifDec on your system.

 III....Where to find additional documentation.


======================================================================

 [ I.	The SifDec distribution and its directory structure ]

  After  unpacking  the  compressed  tarfile   containing  the  SifDec
distribution, the following files should be present in your directory:

    -rw-r--r--   BUGS
    -rw-r--r--   LICENSE
    -rw-r--r--   README
    drwxr-xr-x   build/
    drwxr-xr-x   common/
    drwxr-xr-x   config/
    lrwxrwxrwx   install_sifdec -> ./build/scripts/install_sifdec*
    lrwxrwxrwx   install_script_sifdec -> ./build/scripts/install_script_sifdec*
    lrwxrwxrwx   uninstall_sifdec -> ./build/scripts/uninstall_sifdec*
    lrwxrwxrwx   update_sifdec -> ./build/scripts/update_sifdec*

We now briefly examine each of these files or directories in turn.

  BUGS		file describing when and how to report SifDec bugs

  LICENSE	licensing information

  README	this file

  build/	directory containing some scripts, prototype files and
		architecture-dependent  configuration files  needed by
		the installation script.  The subdirectories of build/
		should be arch/, prototypes/ and scripts/.

  common/	directory  containing all the files that are common to
		all the  local  installations  of SifDec.  These files
		include source files,  documentation files, man pages,
		SIF-encoded problems,  matlab interfaces  and so on...
		The subdirectory structure under common/  should be as
		follows (indentation indicates depth):

		doc/			General documentation,
		man/
		  man1/			Section 1 manpages,
		sif/			SIF-encoded test problems,
		src/
		  select/		select source files,
		  sifdec/		SIF decoder source files.

  config        directory  containing  all the information  pertaining
                to Umakefiles.  It includes the rules used to generate
                the Makefiles  and  the  data  files  related  to  the
                various  supported architectures.

  install_sifdec
		main installation script. This file is a symbolic link
		to build/scripts/install_sifdec. Normally, this is the
		first script that you will run in order to install the
		version of SifDec suited to your needs and system.

  uninstall_sifdec
		maintenance script used to remove an installed version
		of SifDec. Offers the possibility to remove either the
		single or double precision version only.  This file is
		a symbolic link to build/scripts/uninstall_sifdec.

  update_sifdec	used to incorporate changes, bug fixes,  new  versions
		of a  small number of  source files,  this script is a
		symbolic link to build/script/update_sifdec.

  version.date	contains the date and time of the last rebuild of this
		SifDec distribution (prior to your download).


This brief overview of the SifDec directory structure should be enough
for  you to  get  started with  SifDec  and start  coding, testing  or
exploring. More  information is found  in documentation pointed  to in
section III below.


   --- NOTE: ---

After a first installation, a  new directory called log/ will be added
to the  above list, containing  a file named  install.log, summarizing
all the current  (installed) versions of SifDec on  your system.  This
file persists even  if you uninstall all the  present versions and, in
this case, is empty. It is  strongly advised *not* to delete or modify
by hand this log file.


======================================================================

 [ II.	Installing a first version of SifDec on your system ]

 The first step in installing a version of SifDec on your system is to
simply launch the  install_sifdec  script briefly described in section
I  and  to  follow the  directions  that  appear  on the  screen.  The
installation phase  does not require  answers to tricky  questions and
should be  easy to go through.  Should you come  across any particular
difficulty, we  suggest you  move on to  section III below  and follow
links  to more  detailed documentation.  It  may also  be valuable  to
examine  the   install_sifdec   script   itself  as   it   should   be
self-documented.  To start the  installation phase,  simply cd  to the
directory where the SifDec distribution was unpacked and type

	prompt% ./install_sifdec

at the command prompt. You  will be asked simple questions, like which
platform you wish to install SifDec on, which compiler you wish to use
which precision version and size you wish to handle, and the directory
you wish  to install to. SifDec  will then do the  rest, printing some
information on the screen as it proceeds. For a first installation, we
recommend  that you  agree with  the installation  script and  then go
ahead   customizing  your   installation  as   you  progress   in  the
documentation.  A   sample  installation  session   follows.  All  the
prompting comes from the installation script and the answers '5', '2',
'd', 'm' and 'y' are from the user:

     Select platform
	    (1) Compaq (DEC) alpha
	    (2) Cray
	    (3) HP workstation
	    (4) IBM RS/6000
	    (5) PC
	    (6) SGI workstation
	    (7) SUN workstation
	    (0) Other (user-defined)
    5
     Select Fortran compiler
            [1 ]  Fujitsu frt
            [2 ]  Intel ifc
            [3 ]  Layhey lf95
            [4 ]  Portland Group pgf77
            [5 ]  Portland Group pgf90
            [6 ]  Linux f77-f2c
            [7 ]  GNU g77
            [8 ]  GNU g77 without etime
            [9 ]  NAG f90
            [10]  NAG f95
    2
     Set install precision (D=double, s=single):
    d
     Set install size (L=large, m=medium, s=small, c=customized):
    m
     By default, SifDec with your selections will be installed in
      /home/me/Sifdec/SifDec.medium.pc.lnx.ifc
     Is this OK (Y/n)?
    y

The installation script then proceeds creating the directory structure
where your  medium double-precision version of ifc-based  SifDec for a
PC    running   Linux    will    be   hosted,    in   the    directory
/home/me/Sifdec/SifDec.medium.pc.lnx.ifc.      Follow     the    final
instructions, updating  your path,  MANPATH, LIBPATH and  creating the
appropriate  environment variables.   If you  do not  understand those
directions, please  ask your local system  administrator.  Changing to
the newly-created directory, we find the following structure:

    bin/		precision-independent scripts,
    config/             umake configuration files,
    double/
      bin/		precision-dependent scripts and relocatables,
      config/		system-dependent configuration files.

The installation scripts will ask you a couple more questions, to
which you should answer positively if you wish to complete the
installation. These last operations may also be performed by hand, as
we now describe. However, for a first installation, we recommend
answering 'yes' to the questions.

Only  the directory  structure  has  been created  at  this point  and
nothing has been  compiled yet. You must issue  an additional command,
from  the  newly-created directory,  which  is,  in  this case  called
/home/me/Sifdec/SifDec.medium.pc.lnx.ifc. Issuing

	prompt% ./install_mysifdec

at the command  prompt will create the various  Makefiles necessary to
compile all  the SifDec components, from the  Umakefiles. This process
is generally  referred to as  'bootstrapping'. Once the  above command
has finished executing, simply issue the usual

	prompt% make all

to start  compiling everything. This process  should complete smoothly
after  a short  while. Note  that,  as usual,  make outputs  a lot  of
information on  the screen.  It may thus  be much more  informative in
this case to issue

	prompt% make -s all

to  keep make  silent and  let  general information  only be  printed.
Please  refer  to  the README  file found  under  $MYSIFDEC for  more
information on this process.

The  directory  /home/me/Sifdec/SifDec.medium.pc.lnx.ifc/bin  contains
the  scripts  that  you will  run  in  order  to decode  a  particular
SIF-encoded problem. For instance, you could issue the command

	prompt% sifdecode KISSING2

and thereby decode the  constrained problem KISSING2.SIF, creating the
files

    -rw-r--r--     1859 ELFUNS.f
    -rw-r--r--        0 EXTERN.f
    -rw-r--r--      336 GROUPS.f
    -rw-r--r--   278350 OUTSDIF.d
    -rw-r--r--      908 RANGES.f
    -rw-r--r--      297 SETTYP.f

(note  that the exact  files size  may be  slightly different  on your
local system.)


IMPORTANT  NOTE:  Optimization and  linear  algebra  packages used  to
actually solve the problem, or transform it, are *not* provided in the
SifDec  distribution. The CUTEr package

   http://cuter.rl.ac.uk/cuter-www/

provides a number of tools and interfaces to such packages. You
should contact their authors or people in charge in order to get a
copy.

======================================================================

 [ III.	Where to find additional documentation ]

Although this  README file should be  enough to put you  on the tracks
and start using SifDec --- especially if you are already familiar with
any of  its predecessors ---  it clearly is insufficient  for advanced
use  and customization.  As required by the  SifDec  main installation
script,  you  should  have  defined  an  environment  variable  called
SIFDEC and set it to the  directory where SifDec was unpacked.  We use
this environment  variable to  locate files in  the remainder  of this
document.

The  general SifDec documentation  may be  found, in Portable Document
Format  (pdf)  in the  file  $SIFDEC/common/doc/general.pdf. This file
should contain most of the information you need to efficiently use and
manage  SifDec.  Even  though  all  the  scripts  are  intended to  be
self-explanatory and self-documented, we strongly advise that you read
this file and/or backup your  data prior to any uncertain manipulation
and/or modification.

All the SifDec  interfaces, ie the scripts that you  may run to decode
an individual  problem, are documented  under the form of  UNIX manual
pages, section 1.  These manpages are found under

	$SIFDEC/common/man/man1

If  your MANPATH  has  been  correctly set  to  incorporate the  above
directory at the end of the installation, you should be able to access
the manpages using the usual command. For instance

	prompt% man sifdecode

should format the  manpage for the SifDec script  sifdecode (decode or
obtain information about a particular problem).

Finally, as  already mentioned, documentation  may be found  by simply
examining   the  source  code.   The  scripts   are  intended   to  be
self-documented   and  their   purpose  should   be  clear   from  the
comments. You are encouraged to read source code.
