- Improvement: better error messages to improve debugging with multiprocessing
- Improvement: minor improvements of tutorials 2 and 3

Version: 4.3
================

- Improvement: Updated requirements to Python 3.9 or later (Python 3.8 end of life was Oct 7, 2024) and numpy<1.27.0, scipy>=1.11,<1.12 to avoid Python NNLS freeze

- Bugfix: fix a bug that prevents Bayes LOSVD kinematic maps from being created more than once
- Improvement: misc. improvements in documentation and tutorials.
- Improvement: Sampling of grid recording the intrinsic moments (in r, theta, phi) can optionally be defined in the config file's orblib settings.
- Improvement: The installation procedure has been changed to make DYNAMITE compatible with Python 3.12. Installing and uninstalling is now done using pip.
- Improvement: added a new tutorial notebook ``7_orbital_distributions.ipynb`` which takes a closer look at orbit distributions.
- Improvement: the ``weight`` attribute of kinematics is now officially DEPRECATED as it has always been ignored by DYNAMITE.
- Improvement: DYNAMITE now checks for nan values in the kinematics and mges when first reading the data
- Improvement: prevent DYNAMITE from crashing if NNLS weight solving fails.
- Improvement: the Gauss Hermite kinematic maps new parameter value `cbar_lims='user'` allows user-defined velocity and velocity dispersion limits (see `Plotter.plot_kinematic_maps()`).
- Improvement: reduced the main memory requirements of the Python NNLS solvers.
- Bugfix: fix a crash when creating the BayesLOSVD kinematics file in rare cases where the completed bins were determined incorrectly.
- New feature: ``data_prep/generate_kin_input.py`` implements reading NIFS kinematics with an arbitrary number of GH moments.
- Improvement: improved checks and error messages for velocity and spatial bin input data inconsistencies.
- Improvement: save disk space by cleaning up decompressed files after a crash and removing unused legacy file nn_orbmat.out after solving.
- Improvement: stability fix in MGE: if q>0.9999 it will be set to 0.9999 (before, it was 0.99999).
- Bugfix: the chi2 plot now shows correct axis ticks for log quantities.
- Bugfix: fixed colorbar overlap with x-axis in the chi2 plot if only two parameters are varied and added label to chi2 plot colorbar.
- Improvement: ``LegacyWeightSolver`` is now DEPRECATED and will be removed along with GALAHAD in a future version of DYNAMITE. Use weight solver ``type: "NNLS"`` instead if you can.

Version: 4.2
================

- Improvement: if ``number_GH`` in the config file is larger than the kinematic order of the observed data, then DYNAMITE ensures that the corresponding systematic errors are > 0.

- Bugfix: Fixed a bug related to a nonexistent model directory if a crash occurs between the parameter generator adding a model and starting to solve it
- Improvement: Dynamite will no longer crash upon Legacy Fortran errors (except when executables are not found), but issue warnings and assign nan to the affected chi2 values
- Improvement: When executing a dummy run (do_dummy_run==True), model_iterator will set both kinchi2 and kinmapchi2 to nan (instead of zero)
- Improvement: DYNAMITE will retrofit existing all_models tables with the new column kinmapchi2 and calculate its values for existing models whenever possible

- Bugfix: A galaxy with position angle of 0 does not cause error when reading in the config file anymore
- Bugfix: Fix the stars component bug: stellar component was called system.cmp_list[2] before and relied on the stars being the third component. Now this component is called “stars”
- Bugfix: The plotting did not work correctly in VSC where X11 does not work. We therefore put the matplotlib backend to “Agg”
- Bugfix: Removed unused import statements and code clean-up
