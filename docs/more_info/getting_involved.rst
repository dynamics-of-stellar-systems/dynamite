Getting Involved
****************

If you would like to use DYNAMITE for any scientific project, please feel free to get in contact and discuss ideas or if you need help getting started. If you would like to contribute to the code, there are many possible ways to do this:

- write documentation
- write tutorials
- contribute new features

Whist our `public github repository <https://github.com/dynamics-of-stellar-systems/dynamite_release>`_ is rather quiet, we have a very active development (currently private) repository. If you would like to be added to this, please get in contact.
