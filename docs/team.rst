Team

DYNAMITE is mainly developed at the University of Vienna.

Our members are organised into a development team (who are currently involved in coding) and a collaboration team (who are involved in a number of related projects, both scientific and computational). With this distinction, we want to accelerate progress amongst the development team whilst keeping the wider team informed when we reach significant milestones. As we progress, movement between the teams - as well as addition of new members to both - is highly likely.

Development team
================

The development team are those currently involved in coding for DYNAMITE:

* Prashin Jethwa (``prashin.jethwa@univie.ac.at``), postdoc at Uni Wien, co-ordinating and coding for DYNAMITE;

* Sabine Thater (``sabine.thater@univie.ac.at``), postdoc at Uni Wien working on the development of DYNAMITE. In her research, she applies the axisymmetric and the triaxial Schwarzschild code to centres of galaxies. Please contact her if you have questions about the DYNAMITE installation guide.

* Thomas Maindl (``thomas.maindl@univie.ac.at``)

* Glenn van de Ven (``glenn.vandeven@univie.ac.at``), one of the authors of the original triaxial Schwarzschild code that DYNAMITE is based upon.
